description: "Your fantasy team put up a ton of points over the season, yet you missed the playoffs because your opponents always had their best weeks against you. How would your season have gone if you had a different schedule? I re-simulate 15 years of league history to quantify how un/lucky my league's participants have been and to measure how much making the playoffs depends on schedule. (Spolier: a LOT!)"

Coming soon.

I need to dust off the old code (base R!), so i'll be a minute, but the gist is:

-   In 2018 I scraped my ESPN fantasy league's 15-season history, saving the weekly league members' points in a csv.

-   Then I re-simulated every season a million times, taking each owner's weekly score as given, but randomizing the season's head to head schedules.

-   With the simulation results we can explore owners' win-loss distributions, their expected win rates, see who got lucky or unlucky in a given year, and if there's been any persistent luck pattern over the years.

-   I find that schedule plays a huge role in determining playoff berths and using an all-play schedule format (where you play every other team each week) would mitigate this.
