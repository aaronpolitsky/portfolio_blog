From late 2017 through early 2020 I worked nights and weekends as an independent contractor with Pacific Point, Inc., serving primarily as a Tableau consultant for their non-profit clients. My primary client was Hawai'i Data Collaborative who wanted to create interactive visualizations of various well-being metrics in a variety of domains like education, health, economic opportunity, among others. These data were segmented by various types of geographic regions, so mapping would often play a part in the vizzes.

Over the course of the project I worked with them to develop and refine their ideas through prototyping and iteration, and through to implementation and production. While the work was mostly creating interactive dashboards using Tableau, in some cases I wrote some R scripts to wrangle the data into arrangements that Tableau required in order to achieve what we intended.

Final dashboards included:

-   a state-level comparison (Hawai'i vs. other states)

-   an Indicators dashboard, where you can map a set of domain metrics based on a geographic region of your choosing

-   a combination map and scatterplot tool, for exploring arbitrary relationships between several variables

-   a data explorer tool for comparing a region to its peers over a set of metrics

-   a Build Your Own Index dashboard, through which you could select a number of metrics to form an index, and then compare geographic regions using said index.

Head over to [Hawai'i Data Collaborative](https://www.hawaiidata.org/viz-tools) site to view the archived interactive dashboards.

Below is the Indicators Dashboard:

```

Start by **(1)** choosing the tab for the desired geographic **Region** type at the top of the Dashboard.

Next, using the menus on the left side of the Dashboard, **(2)** select either **Demographics** or the well-being **Domain** of interest and **(3)** a corresponding **Indicator**.

Finally, **(4)** select the desired **Year** of data collection. The Dashboard will generate a visualization based on your selections.

I'll write more about the behind-the-scenes when I get some free time.
